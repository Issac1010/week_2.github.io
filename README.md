# Week 2

We had a group discussion in class. Having identified the path for amphibious twin screws, we looked for other similar designs and found the needs that these products could not meet and the needs of the robots we planned to design, mainly for harsh environments. So we find weaknesses in other competitive products that reflect the innovation of the robots we design. The specific event will be the environment of floods, wetlands, ponds, sewers and so on. The challenge for our team is differentiation, which requires us to show innovation and advantages when comparing the robot we design with other products. We also discussed the general steps in designing and building this robot: First, we need to model it; Second, it is necessary to design and make the circuit of the robot; Then the robot's detection system is programmed; Finally, it is necessary to simulate the robot and determine the required materials.
